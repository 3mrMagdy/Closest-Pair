Input file format:
*Each input file contains 1 test case.

*Each test case consists of multiple lines.

*The first line contains 1 integer 'n', the number of points, 2<=n<=1000000.

*Follows n lines, each line represents 1 point in the cartesian plane.

*Each line contains the coordinates of the point as two integers 'x' and 'y', -1000000000<=x,y<=1000000000.

Output file format:
*Each output file contains the output of 1 test case.

*The output file contains only one floating point number,
the distance between the closest pair of points in the test case.

Note:
*You will not be provided with the output files of the secret input test cases, they will be shown in the lab.

*This is not an assignment, it is a graded lab practice, so bring the files with you.
